FCC_Portfolio Site.

A tutorial i learned from free code camp. I thought this site was really nice and would use most of the ideas in my current site. But really this was one of those door openers into Javascript. Which i loved more than the CSS HTML combined. This website being simplistic, opened itself up for customization, so much so that i tried to add in icons to express the languages that i know. The vertical layout is nice, but this layout would not be what i want for my final design. PS: Loved till I went back to C#.
